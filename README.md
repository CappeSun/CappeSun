Yo, I study web development at Yrgo in Gothenburg. I'm aiming for full stack, though with focus on backend. I mostly work with JS, including Node, and PHP, and have found Laravel and Vue to suit me well. Frontend-wise I usually build web apps, as I enjoy interactive and fluent websites. Outside of web, I have some basic experience with C++ and C#.

Other interests I pursue in my free time are music, electronics, CAD and whatever else catches my interest. I'm also working on a livestream service, Dreamcaster, which aims to match the (useful) features of Twitch, in addition to many new. It is currently in passion project status.
